 <p>"Website monetization is the process of converting existing traffic being sent to a particular website into revenue. The most popular ways of monetizing a website are by implementing pay per click (PPC) and cost per impression (CPI/CPM) advertising." (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Website_monetization" title="wikipedia">source</a>)</p>

 <p>Naturally, online stores are another way to profit off the exposure that the world wide web facilitates. There are several options available for creating an online store with simple instructions on how to set them up. Wordpress and PayPal integration, for instance, is very popular (see "<a href="https://www.tipsandtricks-hq.com/wordpress-simple-paypal-shopping-cart-plugin-768" title="WordPress Simple PayPal Shopping Cart Plugin">WordPress simple PayPal shopping cart plugin</a>"). </p>

 <p>Before selecting a specific service or tool to design that store, it's important to research best practices and design principles to make the user's experience as quick and easy as possible. Analyzing existing shopping cards and their strengths and weaknesses is recommended. </p>

 <p>Ogonowski and Rocheleau provide excellent in-depth analysis of existing shopping carts and how their design impacts the number of completed transactions (high level of cart abandonment is a constant source of research as to increase conversion). The consensus seems to be simplicity, natural flow and speed are essential and offer different approaches to achieve them.
