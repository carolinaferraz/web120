 <p>Mobile devices quickly became a common occurrence in our everyday lives and access to information has never been so easy at any point in history. How this information is displayed can have a great impact on its reach and effectiveness.</p>

 <p>This paper aims to briefly compare and contrast the concepts of mobile applications and responsive websites. </p>

 <p>A web app is simply a website that took the mobile-first approach and is designed to be viewed and interacted on a smartphone. Mobile apps, on the other hand, need to be downloaded and installed via an app store and have access to system resources. So, web apps function like mobile apps, but from the comfort of the phone’s browser. (Samanta, 2019).</p>

 <p>" Here are some of the benefits of using responsive web design:
- It has a flexible layout that can respond to any size of the screen
- Provide broader audiences since a majority of people are accessing the internet</p>
- The search engine can quickly index the website with a mobile-friendly view.</p>
- All updates are made in one place as compared to the mobile app.</p>
- Anyone who visits the site can see all the updates." (Humbert, 2018)
</p>
<p>Now, how advantageous mobile applications are:
- "The features of the apps and tools in the mobile phone can easily be integrated to give more significant results than mobile-oriented sites.</p>
<p>- The apps load faster than web pages since they are more efficient to have a better user experience.</p>
<p>- The app helps to create awareness and promote the brand of the business to the user as compared to responsive web design.</p>
<p>- Mobile apps guarantee more significant safety than web pages</p>
<p>- Mobile apps do not require internet connections to function as compared to the responsive web design." (Humbert, 2018)</p>

<p>Since there's a strong trend on the "mobile-first design" paradigm, responsiveness has increasingly become a standard feature of a website due to the incredible popularity of mobile devices in the last two decades. "According to research from SimilarWeb, 63% of website visits in the US come from mobile devices. Consequently, a diminishing share of website visits are on large screens." (Garner, 2019) </p>

<p>Depending on the company/organization, the question of a mobile app in addition to the responsive website offers more room for debate. Apart from arguably offering better performance than the website, some businesses benefit or wouldn't exist without an application. Interactive games or camera-dependent ideas, for instance, wouldn't make as much sense if confined only in desktop browsers or consoles. </p>

<p>Smaller business, on the other hand, wouldn't have the same urgency for that implementation. Creating an online presence can be achieved with websites and social media integration, those usually provide more affordable visibility that can be scaled as demanded.</p>
