 <p>My name is Carolina Ferraz and I'm studying to become a web developer. I also have a Bachelor Degree in English and tons of customer service experience.</p><p> At the moment my favorite type of web development would be as a programmer or work on the server side due to the fact that they are related to my preferred languages (js and php) and I want to get really good at them.</p>
 <p>When I'm not coding I like to go for long walks while listening to music, travel, go to concerts (and take pictures of them) and I also go to the movies a lot.</p>
